2.2 Accommodation.
Dunhuang is one of the most favorite destinations along the “Silk Road”. It welcomes every visitor with many different standards of comfortable accommodation. But, as a small inland city in Northwestern China, the overall accommodation condition is not as best as in well-developed cities like Beijing and Shanghai. There are only few 5 star hotels,while most are budget, economy and comfort hotels.
Most travelers like to stay in downtown area, especially close to the Shazhou Night Market, or accommodate near the Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Lake scenic area, or near Dunhuang Airport and Dunhuang Railway Station. You can book hotels from the three main areas based on your own itinerary and requirements.
