Situated in the interior region of China and surrounded by mountains and deserts, Dunhuang features a temperate continental arid climate, with strongly sunshine, little rainfall, dry air, huge temperature difference between day and night all year round. In Dunhuang, July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 19℃ ~ 35℃, while January is the coldest period when temperature drops to -1℃~ -15℃. It may have sandstorms in Spring and snows in frozen winter. Therefore, late Spring, Summer and Autumn (from May to October) are the best seasons to visit Dunhuang, because at that time, the temperature is acceptable, sky is clear blue and natural scenery is the best and weather is the most suitable in a year.

2.2 Accommodation.
Dunhuang is one of the most favorite destinations along the “Silk Road”. It welcomes every visitor with many different standards of comfortable accommodation. But, as a small inland city in Northwestern China, the overall accommodation condition is not as best as in well-developed cities like Beijing and Shanghai. There are only few 5 star hotels,while most are budget, economy and comfort hotels.
Most travelers like to stay in downtown area, especially close to the Shazhou Night Market, or accommodate near the Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Lake scenic area, or near Dunhuang Airport and Dunhuang Railway Station. You can book hotels from the three main areas based on your own itinerary and requirements.
